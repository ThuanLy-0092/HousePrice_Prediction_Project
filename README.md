# House Price Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning to predict house prices based on various features of the house and its location. The application is built using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating interactive web applications.

## Project Files

### 1. Data Collection

- **Objective:** Scrape and collect data items from the website [Batdongsan.vn](https://batdongsan.vn/ban-nha/) to create a comprehensive dataset.
- **Tasks:**
  - Explore the website thoroughly to gather relevant information on each data item for house price prediction.
  - Determine the size of the dataset to be collected.
  
### 2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- **Objective:** Prepare the data for training machine learning models.
- **Tasks:**
  - Select appropriate data features for training the models.
  - Perform necessary data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  - Conduct feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the selected features.

### 3. Methodology

- **Objective:** Develop and evaluate models for house price prediction.
- **Tasks:**
  - Visualize a heatmap based on the address of the listed house using kernel density estimation at a certain time.
  - Design a methodology to address the house price prediction problem.
  - Consider various approaches and techniques for data analysis and modeling.
  - Justify the chosen methodologies and explain their effectiveness.
  - Recommended models include Linear/Ridge/Lasso Regression, Decision Tree/Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting among others.
